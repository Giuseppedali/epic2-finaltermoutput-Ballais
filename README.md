# epic2-finaltermoutput-Ballais

I created my mandala output using p5.js Web Editor. The design I choose to create is a Polynesian Inspired Mandala. These pays a tribute to all polynesian ancestors on how they survive and how their lives became sustainable before. In a mandala, the shark's fin and shark symbolizes braveness in every circumstances they confront, The Fish scales, Spear Head, and the Sun, it all represents Polynesian Life as Simplicity as it is.

The references that I used for making the mandala output: https://p5js.org/reference/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8DeS2i81IY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se9rsp2VMWk&t=12s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efnl8kPL6Kw&t=9s

If there was no pandemic, i would love to learn more on Game Design and more Coding skills.
